  You can download the pre-extracted patches and the pre-extracted features from https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7c9IgGVCg6IVmUtY01Ga3hqWE0
  
  You can download the pre-trained models from https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7c9IgGVCg6INGp5OW5CcVhCTFU

# usage

  1. dataProcess.m : extract patches from the Oxford dataset by VLFeat (run in matlab)
    or you can directly use the pre-extracted patches
    
  2. extract.sh : extract features from patches by CNN-based models (bash extract.sh)
    or you can directly use the pre-extracted features
    
  3. result.m : evaluate the features extractes by CNN-based models
